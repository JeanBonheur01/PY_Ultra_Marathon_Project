### Problem Statement

The main objective of this data analytics project was to clean up a large dataset consisting of ultra marathon races from different decades. The focus was in the year 2020 and 50km and 50-mile races in the USA, specifically the West Seattle Beach Run - Winter Edition. Thereafter, some critical analytical questions were answered, and graphical representations were performed to gain more insightful information about this race.
### Data Sources

The primary data used for this analysis were the large CSV datasets, consisting of two hundred centuries of race records. These datasets were cleaned and sorted to focus only on the desired portion of the data.

### Tools

- Visual Studio Code: The tool is a code editor optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. It integrates different code editors, such as Python and Jupyter Notebooks, which were activated/enabled to conduct this analysis within Visual Studio Code.
